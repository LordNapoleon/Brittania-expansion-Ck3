  bm_1066_gwynedd_desc: "The Kingdom of Gwynedd is a small Welsh kingdom, but it has the potential to become the dominant power in Wales. The Welsh are a proud people, and they will not be ruled by the English. The Welsh lords are divided, but if you can unite them, you can drive the English out of Wales and become the King of Wales."

He is a strong warrior, and he has the potential to unite the Welsh lords and drive the English out of Wales. He is also the King of Powys, and he has a claim on the Kingdom of Deheubarth. If he can unite the Welsh lords, he can drive the English out of Wales and become the King of Wales."
